	<hr2> Welcome to my first website! This is my first time building a website using code to create a site like this. </h2>
	<hr />
	
    <p>My name is Skylar Williamson! I am a freshman at <strong>NC State</strong> studying mathematics education. I plan to graduate in <em>2023</em>. I chose this major because I like to work with people, I like math, and I enjoy helping people. I also enjoy playing sports like <ins>basketball</ins> and <ins>softball</ins> so I am hopeful that maybe I can coach a team within the school I work in. </p>    
<br />
<br />
	<p>My current job is working at a Seafood Restaurant back in my home town, Manteo NC. My dream job would be to Flip houses. I am still not sure what I will do after I graduate because I also love math and the idea of helping others learn. The two are so different from each other so I am trying to figure out which one is more realistic for me! </p>
<hr />
	<hr4> My Favorite Classes:</hr>
	<ul>
		<li>World Population and Food Studies
		<li>Intro to Education
		<li>Calculus I
		<li>Modern US History
	</ul>
